# JTX Video Skill

## Purpose

Turn a recorded Chinese talking-head video into the user's standard AI-finance Douyin video:

- the speaker is the visual anchor
- motion graphics explain finance/AI/product events
- the style is black-gold business, not flashy template editing
- the workflow is staged and reviewable
- final export includes a 2K 60fps version for publishing
- the source orientation is respected: horizontal input stays horizontal unless the user asks otherwise

## Non-Negotiable Workflow

Never jump straight from source video to a finished edit. Move in this order:

1. **Create project folder**
   - Use `hyperframes-runs/<project-slug>/`.
   - Keep all generated files inside the project folder.

2. **Preprocess source video**
   - Convert the input video to stable H.264 at 30fps with fixed keyframes.
   - Default command shape:
     ```bash
     ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -g 30 -keyint_min 30 -r 30 output_keyed.mp4
     ```
   - Save as `workflow/01_preprocessed_keyed.mp4` and copy/use as `assets/talk-main-keyed.mp4`.
   - Immediately run `ffprobe` and record source orientation:
     - `width > height` = horizontal workflow
     - `height > width` = portrait workflow
   - Save the orientation decision in the project notes / `design.md`. Do not choose layout rules before this decision is made.

3. **Extract audio and transcribe**
   - Extract clean audio, usually `workflow/01_audio_16k.wav`.
   - Use a Chinese-capable high-accuracy transcription model. Do not use `.en` Whisper models for Chinese.
   - First output to the user must be the SRT file path and content summary only.
   - Save SRT as `workflow/01_audio_16k.srt`.

4. **SRT 文件确认**
   - Do not analyze the script, storyboard, or render before the user confirms SRT.

5. **Analyze content structure**
   - Segment the transcript into content types:
     - 开场钩子
     - 痛点呈现
     - 正误对比
     - 流程清单
     - 方法论讲解
     - 案例 / 数据
     - 行动号召
     - 金融观点 / 市场判断
     - AI工具实测 / 产品事件
   - Save as `workflow/05_content_structure_for_review.md`.
   - Ask the user to review.

6. **文案结构确认**
   - Do not generate storyboard until confirmed.

7. **Generate storyboard**
   - Use `templates/storyboard-template.md` as the schema.
   - Include time range,口播内容,文案类型,画面策略,动效元素,音效建议,审核关注点.
   - Before writing the storyboard, branch by source orientation:
     - Horizontal: material-first split layouts are allowed for long evidence/chart explanations.
     - Portrait: the speaker must remain on screen; materials and motion graphics attach as overlays above the speaker.
   - Save as `workflow/06_storyboard_for_review.md`.
   - Ask the user to review.

8. **分镜表确认**
   - Do not generate HyperFrames code before storyboard confirmation.

9. **设计确认并生成项目 design.md**
   - Copy `templates/design-default.md` into the project as `design.md`.
   - Adapt only what the current video needs.
   - Keep the approved defaults unless the user asks otherwise.

10. **Generate HyperFrames project**
    - Use one continuous talking-head video as the base layer.
    - Do not repeatedly mount many slices of the same MP4; it can cause gray preview, freezing, or the speaker disappearing.
    - Put captions and visual explanations in separate timed overlay layers.
    - Prefer concise dynamic keywords over dense cards when there is no external material to show.
    - Use real source images/charts when they are available and relevant; do not redraw unclear symbolic diagrams.
    - Apply the orientation-specific layout rules:
      - Horizontal: may use left-material / right-speaker split scenes when materials need sustained explanation.
      - Portrait: never switch to a full-screen material scene; the speaker stays visible and materials/dynamic text are overlay layers attached to the speaker shot.
    - Main video must be muted; use a separate `<audio>` track.

11. **最终视觉确认**
    - Generate preview/review renders.
    - Use screenshots/contact sheets for visual checks.
    - Apply user feedback on subtitle height, size, transparency, person brightness, card placement, and motion restraint.

12. **Final export**
    - Preserve the source orientation unless the user explicitly asks to convert.
    - Horizontal final version: `2560x1440 / 60fps`.
    - Portrait final version: `1440x2560 / 60fps`.
    - Render a high-quality master, then generate the final 2K 60fps publishing file.
    - Re-mux full original audio after HyperFrames rendering.
    - Verify with `ffprobe`.

## Editing Rules Learned From Review

Use these rules before writing the storyboard and again before rendering:

1. **Find the real topic first**
   - Do not animate every sentence.
   - Extract only the few beats that carry the video: event, key data, core contrast, bottleneck, conclusion.
   - For industry-chain videos, prioritize the event trigger, market-size numbers, margin/comparison numbers, and the true bottleneck.

2. **Use fewer, sharper words**
   - If there is no source material, show only dynamic keywords or numbers.
   - Do not use generic cards just to fill the screen.
   - A key overlay should usually be one line, one number, or one contrast.
   - Avoid stacking many explanatory lines; if everything is highlighted, nothing is highlighted.

3. **Use source material as the main visual when available**
   - Horizontal: if a chart/table/image is the evidence, make the material readable and visually dominant.
   - Portrait: source material can be shown, but only as an overlay on top of the speaker shot unless the user explicitly asks for a full-screen insert.
   - Do not crop important parts of the material.
   - Do not cover the material with duplicate text or redundant labels.
   - Put only the key prompt above or near the material.

4. **Decide horizontal vs portrait before layout**
   - Always inspect `width` and `height` before storyboard/design/code.
   - Do not reuse horizontal split-screen logic on portrait footage.
   - Do not reuse portrait overlay logic when a horizontal video needs readable long-form evidence.
   - Record the decision in `design.md` with the chosen canvas and export target.

5. **Portrait layout rules**
   - The speaker must remain visible for the entire video.
   - Materials, charts, screenshots, and keywords are overlay explanations attached to the speaker shot.
   - Do not create full-screen material takeovers in portrait unless the user explicitly asks.
   - If a source image is provided for a portrait video, use it briefly as an upper overlay, side overlay, or small evidence strip; do not let it replace the speaker.
   - Do not cover eyes, mouth, or key facial expression areas.
   - Prefer top/upper-side overlays for keywords and data; keep bottom reserved for subtitles and Douyin-safe UI.
   - If a phrase's visual emphasis feels like a distracting popup, remove that emphasis and keep the phrase in the full subtitle only.

6. **Horizontal split layout for long material explanation**
   - For horizontal videos with important material, use a two-panel layout:
     - left: large material panel
     - right: synchronized speaker panel
   - Keep material and speaker panels aligned in height.
   - Leave enough gap between title, panels, and subtitles.
   - The material is the primary visual in these sections; the speaker supports the explanation.

7. **Static blurred background in split scenes**
   - When the speaker is shown in a right-side panel, the background behind the panels must not be a live moving copy of the speaker.
   - Use a still frame from the source video as a blurred, darkened background.
   - Only the speaker panel should move.
   - This prevents the viewer from seeing two moving speakers at once.

8. **Animation must match the spoken timing**
   - Do not reveal a number or conclusion before the matching subtitle/口播.
   - Tie overlays to the exact SRT segment that says the key phrase.
   - Example: `$40 -> $60` should appear when the speaker says "从40美金涨到60美金", not when earlier context begins.

9. **Text style**
   - Use solid, heavy, high-contrast Chinese typography for key statements.
   - Avoid hollow, striped, folded, decorative, or textured type unless explicitly requested.
   - Use gold only for the most important number or conclusion.

10. **Subtitles stay independent**
   - Subtitle bars must not overlap material panels or speaker panels.
   - In horizontal split scenes, reserve a clear bottom subtitle band below the main panel.
   - In portrait scenes, subtitles remain the base layer of comprehension; overlays must not compete with the subtitle bar.
   - Subtitle background should be translucent, not fully opaque black.

11. **Render stability**
   - Use one continuous main video as the base.
   - For picture-in-picture speaker panels, prefer pre-cut speaker clips as root-level media layers controlled by opacity.
   - Avoid dynamically creating nested video elements inside timed HTML scenes.
   - Prefer local bundled scripts such as `assets/gsap.min.js` over CDN scripts for renders.
   - After rendering, re-mux full original audio and verify that audio duration is close to video duration.

## Default File Contract

Use this structure:

```text
hyperframes-runs/<project-slug>/
  assets/
    talk-main-keyed.mp4
    talk-main-audio.m4a
  workflow/
    01_preprocessed_keyed.mp4
    01_audio_16k.wav
    01_audio_16k.srt
    05_content_structure_for_review.md
    06_storyboard_for_review.md
  templates/            # optional project-local copies
  design.md
  index.html
  renders/
    review.mp4
    contact-sheet.jpg
    preview-frame.jpg
    final-2k60.mp4
```

## Visual Defaults

Use `templates/design-default.md` as the source of truth for:

- AI金融黑金商务风
- transparent, readable subtitle bar
- bright speaker/person layer
- concise dynamic keywords and restrained motion
- material-first split layout when charts/tables/images are important
- portrait overlay layout when the source video is vertical
- no noisy gold line or flashy decoration
- Douyin-safe subtitles

## Quality Gates

Before telling the user a render is ready:

- Run `npx hyperframes validate`.
- Run `npx hyperframes inspect --samples 12` or denser for risky layouts.
- Use `npx hyperframes snapshot --at ... --describe false` for exact timestamps that received feedback.
- Run `ffprobe` on final MP4.
- Confirm video stream dimensions, frame rate, and duration.
- Confirm audio duration is complete and close to video duration.
- Generate at least one preview frame or contact sheet.
- For split scenes, inspect a frame while the section is active and confirm the blurred background is static.
- For portrait scenes, inspect frames where materials appear and confirm the speaker remains visible.
- For timed key numbers, inspect one frame before the cue and one frame after the cue.
- For any user-reported flicker/popup issue, extract several frames around the timestamp from the rendered MP4, not only from HyperFrames snapshots.

## Export Defaults

Review version:

- Match source orientation unless the user asks otherwise.
- Horizontal review: `2560x1440` or a fast proxy at the same aspect ratio.
- Portrait review: `1080x1920`.
- `30fps` or `60fps` depending on iteration speed
- complete audio remuxed from the original processed audio

Final publishing version:

- Horizontal: `2560x1440`
- Portrait: `1440x2560`
- `60fps`
- H.264 High Profile
- AAC audio
- `+faststart`

Recommended horizontal final encode shape:

```bash
ffmpeg -i master_horizontal_2k30.mp4 -i assets/talk-main-keyed.mp4 \
  -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 \
  -vf "fps=60" \
  -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 17 -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -profile:v high -level 5.2 -movflags +faststart \
  -c:a aac -b:a 192k final-horizontal-2k60.mp4
```

Recommended portrait final encode shape:

```bash
ffmpeg -i master_1080p60.mp4 \
  -vf "scale=1440:2560:flags=lanczos,fps=60" \
  -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 17 -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -profile:v high -level 5.2 -movflags +faststart \
  -c:a copy final-2k60.mp4
```

## Avoid

- Do not cut before SRT confirmation.
- Do not skip storyboard review.
- Do not make the production process itself appear in the video unless that is the topic.
- Do not add full-height scrolling gold lines or flashy decorative effects.
- Do not darken the entire speaker with a heavy black overlay.
- Do not put subtitles too low where Douyin UI covers them.
- Do not make subtitle backgrounds fully opaque black.
- Do not convert horizontal source video to portrait unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not convert portrait source video to horizontal unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not use dense cards when a short dynamic keyword or real material is enough.
- Do not show a live moving background speaker behind a picture-in-picture speaker panel.
- Do not let a portrait video become a full-screen PPT/material video; the speaker must stay visible.
- Do not reveal key numbers before the matching口播/SRT timing.
- Do not invent financial facts, stock claims, prices, dates, or performance data.
- Do not imply investment advice or喊单.

## Response Style

When running this skill, report the current stage and next approval point. Keep the user in control of:

- SRT confirmation
- 文案结构确认
- 分镜表确认
- 设计确认
- 最终视觉确认

If the user says "继续", continue to the next unblocked stage.
